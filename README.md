This was a project inspired by [the Adventure Sanwich Kickstarter](http://adventuresandwich.org/). The user can "paint" with cardboard to make shapes, and once they've done that, they can paint on top of them with either paint (broad brush, semi-transparent) or markers (thinner lines, fully opaque). They can also switch to an eraser at any time, which will only erase the current tool (cardboard, paint, or marker).
